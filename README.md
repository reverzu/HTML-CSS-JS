Pig Game from scratch

This is a Pig Game made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was inspired by Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann's Pig Game, which was recommended by a friend.

This game is a two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach a certain score, typically 100 points. Players take turns rolling two dice and adding the results to their running total. If a player rolls a 1 on either die, they lose all of their points for that turn. Players can choose to "hold" at any time, which means that they keep their current score and pass the turn to the next player. The first player to reach the winning score wins the game.

This Pig Game is fully functional and includes all of the features of the classic game, such as:

Two-player mode
Running total for each player
The ability to roll two dice and add the results to the running total
The ability to "hold" and pass the turn to the next player
A winning score of 100 points
This game is a great way to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It is also a lot of fun to play with friends and family.
